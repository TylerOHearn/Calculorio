<h4 align="center">Simple Calculator App</h4>

## Description
A simple non-scientific calculator app showcasing proof of concept for operations logic. Refreshing cucumber themed color palette for an improved aesthetic.

Written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6) architecture and uses the [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) logging library, the app has barebones functionality but the codebase is organized and clean.
